## 🧠 DeskCo — Personal Desktop Assistant (WIP)

I’m currently building DeskCo, a desktop app focused on productivity. It allows users to control their computer, find files, and run AI text actions instantly from a single command bar. 

The goal is to make everyday computer use smoother. There’s no app switching, no prompt writing, and no messy user interfaces.

What it can do :

- Launch apps and folders
- Open websites using natural commands
- Find local files instantly
- Run quick calculations and conversions
- Summarize, rewrite, or translate copied text with AI

Why this project matters to me: 
I want to create practical tools that people will actually use daily. I’m not interested in just demo apps or projects for hackathons.

Stack: 
Electron, React, Node.js, OpenAI API

Status: 
Actively building (Jan 2026 MVP sprint)
